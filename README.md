# 📦 Smart Logistics Dashboard — UPL Internship Project

A responsive, real-time logistics monitoring dashboard built with **Next.js** during my internship at **UPL (under SUPERFORM)**. The system enables logistics managers to track vehicle movements, monitor route delays, and analyze inventory in a centralized, visual interface — supporting faster, data-driven decisions across the supply chain.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Smart Logistics Dashboard** aggregates data from various logistics sources to offer end-to-end visibility into transportation and inventory operations. It helps identify delivery bottlenecks, track fleet performance, and maintain stock-level efficiency across warehouses and distribution points.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Built a fully responsive dashboard using **Next.js** and modern frontend tooling
* Worked with real logistics datasets to derive meaningful KPIs
* Collaborated with operations and backend teams for requirement gathering
* Applied data visualization for real-time supply chain decision-making

---

## 📌 Notes

* This is a proof-of-concept and all shared data is anonymized or simulated.
* The original dashboard was developed for internal use at UPL.
